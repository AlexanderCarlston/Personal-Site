# personal-project

> I worked on this website a long time ago, so unfortunately this website isn't mobile friendly. However, this was my first time implementing a feature in to my code, so I am proud of that.

## Built With:
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - Front End Framework
* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) - Fast design prototyping (might change to vanilla)
* [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) - Navigation

## Uses:
* [Server]() - PostgreSQL server

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
